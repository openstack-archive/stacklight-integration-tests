- **rootCA.key** is the key used to self-signed rootCA.pem
- **rootCA.pem** is the certificate that will act as the **StackLight Root Authority**
- **md5.txt** that contains the checksum of the two previous files

The **rootCA.pem** is the one that you need to add to your client to
authenticate certificates that will be signed by this certificate.

The certificate has the following information:
```
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number: 10160165599701850419 (0x8d0028c8355f5933)
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: C=FR, ST=Rhone-Alpes, L=Grenoble, O=Mirantis, OU=StackLight, CN=StackLight Root Authority/emailAddress=mirantis@example.com

# Client settings

To be able to validate the certificate generated by the **StackLight Root
Authority** you need to download it into your web browser or pass it to
the client by using the correct option.

# Create a certificate

To create a certificate you just need to run the script
**create_certificate.sh** provided in this directory. You must pass the common
name that will be used in the cerficate by your plugin. For example if you
need a certificate for the *Elasticsearch-Kibana* plugin and if you will
access to the server with the FQDN *kibana.fuel.local* you will generate the
certificate by running:
```
create_certificate.sh kibana.fuel.local
```

It will create four files:
- kibana.key: the private key
- kibana.csr: the certificate singing request. The script will create a
  certificate with the following parameters:
  - Common Name: *kibana.fuel.local* (that parameter you gave to the script)
  - Organization: *Mirantis*
  - Organizational Unit: *Fuel plugins*
  - City: *Grenoble*
  - State: *Rhone-Alpes*
  - Country: *FR*
- kibana.crt: The certificate signed by the StackLight authority
- kibana.pem: The concatenation of the CRT certificate and the private key

Only **kibana.pem** is needed for configuring the Fuel plugin. Currently you
can only pass the common name as a parameter. But it is easy to modify the
other parameters directly in the script if needed.

If you don't want to use the script and prefer to do it manually, follow these
steps:

- Generate the key for the plugin _my-plugin_.
```
openssl genrsa -out my-plugin.key 2048
```

- Create the certificate signing request.
```
openssl req -new -key my-plugin.key -out my-plugin.csr
```
Here is an example on how to fill the fields for the Grafana plugin where
the choosen FQDN is _grafana.fuel.local_:
```
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:FR
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Rhone-Alpes
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Grenoble
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Mirantis
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Fuel plugins
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:grafana.fuel.local
Email Address []:mirantis@example.com
Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:
An optional company name []:
```
For _challenge password_ and _optional company_ just press enter.

- Sign it with the CA root key.
```
openssl x509 -req -in my-plugin.csr -CA rootCA.pem -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out my-plugin.crt -days 500 -sha256
```

- Concatenate the certificate and the private key into a single file.
```
cat my-plugin.crt my-plugin.key > my-plugin.pem
```
